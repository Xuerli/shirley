    title: 'Masters in Psychology (Conversion, Part-time)',
    content: <p> I am studying Psychology part-time with a scholarship from the School of Informatics, the University of Edinburgh. Mental health plays 
              such an important role in human's daily life. Better mental health support will hugely improve lots of people's well-being. 
              However, support from human experts is limited compared with the need in society. Thus, I hope to apply AI technologies to assist 
              Psychological experts for better mental health support. To make a better combination of AI with Psychology, I decided to take this 
              MSc course to learn the knowledge from the field of Psychology. </p>

by combining three existing techniques: abduction, belief revision and conceptual
change (ABC). Based on devised mathematical models, the ABC system repairs faulty
theories with better results than the individual techniques it combines because of its
various operations: 1) add/delete axioms; 2) add/delete preconditions from rules; 3)
change the language of the theory. Furthermore, ABC has wide applications, e.g.
modelling game theory by abductively explaining given observations; root-cause
analysis in system maintenance, and it has the potential to be extended to data in other
formats.

    My dissertation was about the development of a software system with UI, which forecasts the power range of high-
frequency surface wave radar (HFSWR). Based on the mechanism of HFSWR
detection, simulation models were established for the surface wave propagation, target
echo, clutter jamming (environmental noise and sea clutter) and the signal-noise ratio
of HFSWR. It was implemented in C/C# and Fortran languages. As a result, the user
interface software predicts the scope of HFSWR. </p>

As the maintenance of a large system is expensive, our work contributes to making the task interactive between the ABC system and domain experts. Our team also worked on automatic KG construction with probabilities. </p>
